### SPOILER ALERT: CONTAINS ANSWERS TO PROJECT EULER QUESTIONS
### DON'T SPOIL FOR YOURSELF

# Why do these?

I'd like to work on my skills in both math and software engineering.

    Project Euler offers over 900 problems that are great for both fun 
    and education. With a range of challenges from simple to extremely 
    difficult, it's a fantastic way to improve software engineering skills.
    Even though the site has been around for a while, it's still a valuable
    resource for leveling up.
